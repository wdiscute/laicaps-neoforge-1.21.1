Laicaps allows you to travel to three distinct worlds, exploring them at your own pace while gathering materials and knowledge to continue your journey forward.

Asha – A peaceful, overworld-like planet with gentle terrain and no visible threats. Lush forests and glowing wildlife make it an ideal target for your first space expedition!



Lunamar – A vast ocean planet locked in permanent night. Peaceful marine life and bioluminescent plants create a quiet, mysterious underwater environment.




Ember – A volatile volcanic world cloaked in ash. Dangerous terrain and extreme heat pose a challenge, but valuable resources await.
