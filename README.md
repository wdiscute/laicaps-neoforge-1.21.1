Laicaps is a space mod that emphasizes exploration, environmental storytelling, and atmosphere, with a gradual sense of progression from one planet to the next.

- Harvest unfamiliar flora with unique properties. 
- Explore three vastly different planets, each with its own atmosphere and ecosystem.
- Solve puzzles as you uncover the traces of those who came before you.

Laicaps adds three distinct planets, allowing you to explore them at your own pace while gathering materials and knowledge to continue your journey forward.

It features an entry-based, unlockable in-game guide that expands as you explore and learn about each planet and its features.
